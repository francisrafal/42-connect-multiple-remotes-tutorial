# How To Connect Multiple Remotes To Your 42 Project To Backup Your Projects

This tutorial for 42 students explains how to backup your projects on GitHub. 

If you have a local repository for a project that you simultaneously want to push to the Vogsphere and your GitHub account as a backup, here's how to do it:

0. Create a GitHub account and connect it with your 42 machine by adding your SSH key to your account (the same SSH key that you used for connecting to the Vogsphere). 
- Create a GitHub account here: https://github.com/signup
- Here's how to add your SSH key to your account: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account
